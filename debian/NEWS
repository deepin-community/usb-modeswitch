usb-modeswitch (1.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  UPSTREAM: Version 1.0.5 introduces two major changes.
   
  * The devices configuration is split:
    - /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf is dropped in favor of files in
      /etc/usb_modeswitch.d/
    - This means that the customisation or new devices that were defined in 
      /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf will be _LOST_.
    + Normally, there no need anymore to play with comments and such to only
      get the correct devices switched.

  * The detection of devices is greatly improved:
    - /etc/udev/rules.d/usb_modeswitch.rules (Debian-specific) is dropped in 
      favor of /etc/udev/rules.d/80-usb_modeswitch.rules (from upstream).
      These rules call /usr/share/usb_modeswitch/usb_modeswitch.{sh,tcl} to 
      handle the automagical detection and switching of the devices.
    - This means that any device selection done by comment-tweak in the
      Debian-specific .rules file will be lost.
    + But it is normally replaced by a superior and more universal device
      detection.

  Finally, if you had modified /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf to insert home-brewn 
  tweaks, you will need to migrate these tweaks to /etc/usb_modeswitch.d/*
  files. But if you had only selected alternative devices in 
  /etc/udev/usb_modeswitch.rules, you should normally have nothing to do, as
  these alternatives should now be detected (read below).

  DEBIAN: Version 1.0.5-1 now makes the rules "opt-in"

  * udev (from version 146-1) now ships a modem-modeswitch program that does
    what usb-modeswitch used to do. To ensure that the transition to this udev
    facility is smooth for everyone, the usb-modeswitch program is kept, but
    with an opt-in /etc/udev/rules.d/80-usb_modeswitch.rules.
  * Thus if modem-modeswitch from udev (>= 146-1) works for your device, you
    can uninstall usb-modeswitch.
  * A contrario, if modem-modeswitch doesn't switch your device, please file a
    bug against udev and edit /etc/udev/rules.d/80-usb_modeswitch.rules to
    enable it.

usb-modeswitch (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  For the 1.0.0 release, the command line options have changed in two ways from
  their behavior in the 0.9.* versions:
   * On/off flags don't require arguments anymore (e.g. '-H' instead of '-H 1')
   * long option names changed to standard format (e.g. --huawei-mode instead
     of --HuaweiMode).

  The old options are _not_ recognised and _will_ make usb_modeswitch fail. So
  check your scripts and everything that might be using these command lines.
